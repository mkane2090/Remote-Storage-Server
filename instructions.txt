This application requires pip and venv to be available. If they are not available they can be installed on using the apt package manager with the following commands:

sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-venv
	In my case the command was sudo apt install python3.8-venv but it may vary for different installation versions.
sudo apt install mysql-server

Ensure that both pip and venv are available before continuing.

Run the following commands:

sudo mysql
CREATE USER 'server'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'server_password';
GRANT CREATE,ALTER,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,SELECT,RELOAD on *.* TO 'server'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

After ensuring that both pip and venv are available, run the setup.sh command. This will create a virtual environment for the server to run in and will install flask
which will run the API.
